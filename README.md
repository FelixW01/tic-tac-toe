# Tic Tac Toe

## Description
A simple React Tic-Tac-Toe game designed to reinforce state management and event handling. Players take turns marking the board, with the game determining the winner or a draw. This project helps practice managing component state, handling user interactions, and rendering dynamic UI updates.

### Component, reusable pieces of UI
Game Component: Handles the game logic, history tracking, and winner determination.

Board Component: Displays the 3x3 grid and manages individual squares.

Square Component: Represents each square and allows users to make moves.

### Props, allow components to receive data from their parent
The Game component passes the current board state to the Board component as a prop.

The Board component passes individual square values to the Square components.

### State, data that React tracks and updates when changed
Which playerâ€™s turn it is (X or O)

The game board (current squares array)

Move history for undo functionality
